# ALOD2Vec Matcher
This matcher uses <a href="http://kgvec2go.org/">KGvec2go<a/> to retrieve vectors at runtime which are then used
for ontology matching.
For this project, the <a href="https://github.com/dwslab/melt/">MELT framework</a> has been extended with a 
<a href="https://github.com/dwslab/melt/tree/master/matching-ml/src/main/java/de/uni_mannheim/informatik/dws/melt/matching_ml/kgvec2go">KGvec2go Client</a>.
Make sure that you have a working Internet connection before running this matching system. 
The matcher is implemented with the <a href="https://github.com/dwslab/melt/">Matching and EvaLuation Toolkit (MELT)</a> and
can be packaged for SEALS.

The ALOD2Vec Matcher participated in the <a href="http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/">OAEI</a> campaigns <a href="http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2018/">2018</a> and 
<a href="http://oaei.ontologymatching.org/2020/">2020</a>. The implementation found in this
repository is that of the 2020 campaign.
